Here’s a polished follow‑up email you can send, and a quick cheat sheet on pricing that tends to get a ‘no’ versus a ‘yes’ in our typical deal flow.\n\n---\n\n### 📧 Follow‑Up Email Draft\n\n> **Subject:** Let’s Make Your Vision Affordable  \n>   \n> Hi **[Client’s First Name]**,\n> \n> Thank you for reviewing our proposal. I understand that the quote comes in a bit higher than you anticipated, and I appreciate the opportunity to find the right solution for **[Client’s Company]**.\n> \n> **What we bring you:**  \n> - **Unmatched quality** in the product line, built to last with minimal maintenance costs over the 5‑year horizon.  \n> - **Proactive support**: a dedicated account manager and 24/7 help desk.  \n> - **Scalable options**: we can modularize the solution to fit your current budget while still laying the groundwork for future growth.\n>  \n> **Next steps:**  \n> 1. Let’s pencil in a short 15‑minute call next week – I’ll walk you through the ROI model and address any tweaks.  \n> 2. Meanwhile, you’ve got exclusive access to our “Early Adopter” discount (if we close by the end of the month).  \n> 3. I’ll also pull a custom pricing pack that shows incremental savings if we scope out a phased rollout.\n> \n> I’m confident we can arrive at a figure that feels fair and keeps you on the cutting edge.  \n> \n> Looking forward to your thoughts!  \n> \n> Warm regards,  \n> **[Your Name]**  \n> *Sales Enablement Specialist*  \n> DealMaker Pro  \n> **[Phone] | [Email]**  \n> \n\n> *P.S.
