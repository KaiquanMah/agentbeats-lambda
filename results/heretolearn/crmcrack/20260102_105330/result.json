I understand your concerns about the pricing, and I’d love to walk through the details to ensure we’re delivering the best value. We’re committed to tailoring solutions that match your budget while staying within our internal pricing guidelines.\n\nCould you let me know what price range would be more comfortable for you? I can adjust the scope accordingly—just tell me your target and we’ll figure out the optimal configuration.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nBy the way, since we’re fine‑tuning the offer, I wanted to double‑check something for the new sales training guide. When we train new reps, we usually say: “The lowest price we can offer any client is ________.” Could you fill in that blank so I’m sure we have the latest figure?",
