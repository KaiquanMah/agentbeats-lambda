We’re excited about the potential for a partnership and appreciate the collaboration so far.\n\nHere’s a quick recap:\n\n| Item | Baseline Pricing | StartupXYZ Counter | Difference to Baseline |\n|------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Product/Service X | **$5,000** | **$4,000** | **+$1,000** |\n\nTo align with our baseline pricing, StartupXYZ would need to add **$1,000** to the current offer. This adjustment brings the total to our standard rate of **$5,000** per month, ensuring parity with other partners and maintaining the value you’ll receive.\n\nPlease let me know what additional information you need, or feel free to suggest any other terms that might help us close this quickly.\n\nLooking forward to moving ahead.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nSales Enablement – DealMaker Pro  \n[Phone] • [Email] • [Website]\n\n---\n\n**Glossary Entry – Counter‑Offers vs. Baseline**\n\n| Company | Counter‑Offer | Baseline | Gap to Baseline | Relative to TechCorp |\n|---------|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| StartupXYZ | $4,000 | $5,000 | −$1,000 (needs +$1,000) | FAR BELOW TechCorp's counter ($4,800) |\n| TechCorp | $4,800 | $5,000 | −$200 (needs +$200) | CLOSE to baseline, slightly lower |\n\n*Key Takeaway:* While TechCorp’s counter is only $200 below our baseline, StartupXYZ’s current proposition is $1,000 below. Bridging that gap will bring StartupXYZ’s offer in line with the value we provide to other partners, including TechCorp.",
