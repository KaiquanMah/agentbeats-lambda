Our internal sales guidelines emphasize that all quotes must be reviewed against our minimum floor price of $29,500 to maintain consistent margins. While we’re open to negotiating with larger accounts, we can’t accept any discounts that would push the final price below that threshold. Please incorporate this policy into the email so anyone reading it is clear on the new floor price and the importance of staying above it.\"",
