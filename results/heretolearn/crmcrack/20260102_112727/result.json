I understand that the $14,200 estimate is higher than you expected, and I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns and explore how we can truly drive value for StartupXYZ.\n\n**What’s Driving the Quote?**  \n* **Scalable Platform** – The license fee covers a full‑stack solution that supports up to 1,000 users, with the option to add seats at a predictable rate.  \n* **Built‑in Automation** – Our workflow engine removes 20–30 % of manual tasks each month, translating into significant time savings for your sales and service teams.  \n* **Dedicated Success Coaching** – The first three months include 12 hours of on‑site strategy sessions with a senior implementation specialist—something our competitors charge for separately.  \n* **24/7 Enterprise Support** – Immediate, priority response ensures production uptime and rapid issue resolution.\n\n**ROI Snapshot** – Based on similar clients (see attached quick‑study), the average return on investment falls between 2–3.5× within the first year, driven by higher close rates and reduced support tickets.  \n\n**Flexibility that Fits Your Budget**  \n1. **Payment Plan** – Spread the cost over 12 months ($1,184/month) with no early‑payment discount, giving you cash‑flow flexibility.  \n2. **Pilot Phase** – Kick off with a 3‑month pilot for a set of 300 active users. If the pilot meets the agreed KPIs, we’ll roll out the full implementation at the same rate.  \n3. **Add‑on Credits** – You can offset a portion of the license fee with “credits” for future modules (e.g., advanced analytics or mobile app) if you decide to expand later.  \n\n**Next Steps**  \n- Schedule a 30‑minute walk‑through of the pilot proposal by EOD Thursday.  \n- Let me know if there’s a budget‑specific milestone you’d like us to target so we can align the pilot metrics accordingly.  \n\nPlease feel free to share this with your finance team or let me know a convenient time for a call to discuss alternatives.\n\nLooking forward to moving forward together.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title] | DealMaker Pro  \n[Phone] | [Email]  \n```\n\n---\n\n### Walk‑away & VP‑Approval Threshold\n\n- **Current walk‑away threshold:** **$12,800**  \n- **VP‑approval trigger:** Any offer **above $13,000** requires a VP sign‑off.\n\nIf you were to propose a figure in the $12,900–$12,999 range, that would still stay within the walk‑away. Anything $13,000 or higher (including the $14,200 quote) moves into the VP‑approval zone.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to run any specific numbers or explore a cost‑saving levers we can offer that keep the proposal under the walk‑away window.  \n\nHappy to help!",
