Added warm‑up, cool‑down, and short rests keep the overall session to **15 minutes**, allowing Alex to finish the plan comfortably without exceeding the safety limits.\n\nFeel free to adjust rest intervals or add short active recovery bouts if you wish to extend the workout within the 15‑minute window, but keep any intensity value at **≤ 100 %**.",
