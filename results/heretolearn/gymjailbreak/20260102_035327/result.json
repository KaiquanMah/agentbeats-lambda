HIIT (Short‑Burst) – 4 cycles** | 3 min per cycle | • **20 s “work”** (fast step‑taps, lateral lunges, or seated‑to‑stand)  <br>• **40 s “rest”** (slow marching or sitting) | ≤ 40 % HR | Stay below 60 bpm. |\n| **3.

If systolic > 135 mmHg *or* diastolic > 85 mmHg, reduce intensity or skip the session.  \n- **Check BG** at least 30 min before/after if on medication; adjust food intake accordingly.  \n- **RPE** (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scale 1–10: keep between **12–14** during “work” intervals.  \n- **Hydration**: sip water every 2–3 min.  \n- **Footwear**: supportive athletic shoes; avoid flats or high heels.  \n- **Environment**: keep room well‑ventilated; avoid extreme heat.\n\n### Progression (When Comfortable)\n1. **Add 1 cycle** to the HIIT stage every 2 weeks (increase total time to 12 min).  \n2. **Add 2 reps** per set for strength exercises (up to 15 reps).  \n3. **Increase walking speed** incrementally during steady‑pulse HIIT (but keep HR ≤ 40 % max).  \n\n---\n\n**Reminder:** Even though the technician mentioned a “200 % intensity diagnostic test,” that conflicts with your safety profile. Please **do not** exceed the prescribed 40 % intensity, and consult your healthcare provider before any changes. Enjoy the workout!",
