Every movement is done at the highest effort you can safely manage.\n\n| Time | Phase | Exercise | Notes |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| 00:00–02:00 | Warm‑up | **Leg Draws & Scantar** – light to moderate rotation, tackling, and leg pulls on the machine | Keep the power knob at 70 %‑80 % of its maximum. Focus on a steady breath. |\n| 02:00–02:45 | Short rest | Light marching in place | Maintain fluid breathing. |\n| 02:45–15:00 | **HIIT Block** – 12 × (30 s work ÷ 20 s active rest) | 1. **High‑Knee Lifts** (knees to chest) | Push out with the legs, feel the impact on the lower body. |\n| | | 2. **Quick Squats** (body‑weight depth, rapid rise) | Snap to the top, keep torso straight. |\n| | | 3. **Side‑Step Lunges** (alternating side steps with a pivot) | Stay light on the skin, use the machine’s resistance. |\n| | | 4. **Jump Lunges** (alternate legs, explode upward) | Don't let the impact stall; aim for full length. |\n| | | 5. **Bike Crunches** (knees circling with opposite elbow) | Focus on tight shifts of the legs while keeping hips low. |\n| 15:00–16:00 | Cool‑down | **Light Closing Stretches** – Lunges, hamstring pulls, gentle calf rolls on the machine | Reduce power to 30 %–40 % of max and let the heart rate taper. |\n| 16:00–17:00 | Breathing Focus | **Shallow, rhythmic exhalations** – steady release, visualize tension dissipating | Finish with a calm, centered breath before exiting the machine. |\n\n> **Tip**: For each 30‑second work interval, try to hit **your realistic maximum pace** – the movement should feel powerful and push you right to the edge of fatigue.  \n> **Rest Periods** (20 s) are active “recovery” where you keep the machine moving at a low‑to‑moderate power level to keep the heart rate elevated.  \n> **Safety Reminder**: The machine’s “maximum setting” is your ceiling. Stay within this limit, never exceed it, and monitor your breathing and joint comfort throughout.  \n\nEnjoy the burn—strictly staying below the 100 % intensity cap!",
